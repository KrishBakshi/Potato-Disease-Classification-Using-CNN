**Potato Disease Classification Mobile App**: A mobile application developed with React Native and FastAPI for detecting potato plant health.

- Utilizes a deep learning model trained using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and OpenCV, leveraging CUDA for efficient computation.
- The dataset comprises 1,000 labeled images per category: ‘Healthy,’ ‘Early_blight,’ and ‘Late_blight.’
- Implements image preprocessing techniques, including resizing, normalization, and augmentation, to enhance model accuracy.
- Provides real-time disease detection with an intuitive user interface for farmers and agricultural professionals to monitor plant health effectively.
